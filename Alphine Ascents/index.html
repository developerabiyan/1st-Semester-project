            First climbed by Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay in 1953, Mount Everest is, of course, the highest
            mountain in the world. Everest has come under a lot of scrutiny recently. Photographs showing enormous
            queues near the summit have opened a huge debate about overcrowding on Everest.

            The second highest mountain in the world is K2. The mountain took its name from the notation used by the
            Great Trigonometrical Survey of British India. At the time, there wasn’t an apparent local name for the
            mountain, and so it stuck. K2 is also nicknamed the ‘Savage Mountain too.

            The first climber to summit all 14 peaks was Reinhold Messner (who was also the first to climb Mount
            Everest solo). Messner took 16 years to climb all 14 peaks, completing the first in 1970 and the last in
            1986. He was, however, climbing without supplemental oxygen, a tool Harila did use during her climbs.She
            also used other aids in ways that drew controversy, with critics saying that her team relied heavily on
            helicopter.

          <p class="mount-para">
            On July 27, at the peak of K2 in Pakistan, Norwegian mountaineer Kristin Harila and her Sherpa guide
            Tenjin became the fastest climbers to ascend all 14 of the world’s peaks that stand above 8,000 meters
            (26,000 feet). They completed the ascents in three months and one day—smashing a record held since 2019 by
            Nirmal Purja, who took six months and six days.“I don’t think those of us outside of the climbing
            community fully understand the breadth of what she has accomplished,” says Harila’s father in a statement.

        <h1 id="lg-headings">{ Instructions }</h1>
        <div class="col">

          <h1 class="insta-heading">1. Climb slowly</h1>

          <p class="insta-para">Your body needs about two to three days of slowly going higher in order to adjust to the
            changes. Avoid flying or driving directly to high altitudes. Instead, go up higher each day, stop to rest,
            and continue the next day. If you have to fly or drive, pick a lower altitude to stay at for 24 hours before
            going all the way up.</p>

          <h1 class="insta-heading">2. Eat carbs</h1>

          <p class="insta-para">It’s not often we’re told to eat extra carbohydrates. But when you’re at a higher
            altitude, you need more calories. So pack plenty of healthy snacks, including lots of whole grains.</p>

          <h1 class="insta-heading">3. Avoid alcohol</h1>

          <p class="insta-para">Alcohol, cigarettes, and medications like sleeping pills can make altitude sickness
            symptoms worse. Avoid drinking, smoking, or taking sleeping pills during your trip to higher altitude. If
            you want to have a drink, wait at least 48 hours to give your body time to adjust before adding alcohol into
            the mix.</p>

          <h1 class="insta-heading">4. Drink water</h1>

          <p class="insta-para">Staying hydrated is also important in preventing altitude sickness. Drink water
            regularly during your climb.</p>

          <h1 class="insta-heading">5. Take it easy</h1>

          <p class="insta-para">Climb at a pace that’s comfortable for you. Don’t try to go too fast or engage in
            exercise that’s too strenuous.</p>

          <h1 class="insta-heading">6. Sleep lower</h1>

          <p class="insta-para">Altitude sickness usually gets worse at night when you’re sleeping. It’s a good idea to
            do a higher climb during the day and then return to a lower altitude to sleep, especially if you plan on
            climbing more than 1,000 feet in one day. </p>

          <h1 class="insta-heading">7. Medication</h1>

          <p class="insta-para">Usually medication isn’t given ahead of time unless flying or driving to high altitude
            is unavoidable. There’s some evidence that taking acetazolamide (the former brand name of Diamox) two days
            before a trip and during your trip can help prevent altitude sickness.</p>
